# Introduction and gameplay
This is an endless 2D shooter game in Pygame. It was created in fall 2019. The arrow keys are used to move, and the space button to shoot. The player must shoot the blue enemies, which seek the player, and have randomly generated start positions. If touched, the player dies. The aim of the game is to kill as many enemies as possible before the game gets too hard.
